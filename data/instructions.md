We took the dataset from uniprot.org.
The dataset used in this experiment should have all the sequences reviewed (i.e 
choose swissProt and not uniProt on the website.) 
Link to dataset : <a href="ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz">ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz</a>
The dataset should be tab separated and should have 4th column as family name.
